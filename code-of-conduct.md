# Triangle DevOps Code of Conduct

Triangle DevOps is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.

Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the community at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

If you are being harassed, notice someone else is being harassed, or have other
concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep events and online spaces as
welcoming environments for all participants.

This includes warning the offender or expulsion from meetings, events, and any
online spaces this group uses presently or decides to use in the future.

These rules apply at all meetings, events, meeting or event-related social
activities (e.g. a meal or beer before or after the main event). These rules
also apply to the group's online spaces.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our events and online spaces for everyone. We want you to be happy at
our meetings and events and participating in our online spaces. People like you
make them all better. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

### Anonymous reporting

You can make an anonymous report here [FIXME: Wufoo form or similar that DOES 
NOT require an email address to submit. <http://www.wufoo.com/>]

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully
investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

### Personal reporting

You can make a personal report by:

* Calling or messaging this phone number: [FIXME: Phone number for reporting].
  This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the 
  event.
* Contacting a staff member, identified by ORGANIZER badges or buttons.
* Emailing the organizing team [FIXME: email address for contact]

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be
overheard. They may involve other organizers to ensure your report is managed
properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be
upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell
anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact local law enforcement, local support
services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration
of the event. We value your attendance.
