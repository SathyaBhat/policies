# Triangle DevOps Code of Conduct

Triangle DevOps is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.

Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the community at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment
for all participants.

This includes warning the offender or expulsion from meetings, events, and any
online spaces this group uses presently or decides to use in the future.

Organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear
impact of disrupting meetings, events, and/or online spaces or making the
environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these
rules at all meetings, events, meeting or event-related social activities (e.g.
a meal or beer before or after the main event). These rules also apply to the
group's online spaces. We think people should follow these rules outside event
activities too!

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our events and online spaces for everyone. We want you to be happy at
our meetings and events and participating in our online spaces. People like you
make them all better. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.
